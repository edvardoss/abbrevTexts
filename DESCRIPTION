Title: Functions that will make life less sad when working with abbreviated text for multiclassification tasks

Description: Typically, the classification of texts follows the beaten path of stemming, using stop words and clearing low-frequency words from the matrix at a given threshold.
    But when it comes to short, concise abbreviated texts (often with a mixture of several languages), with a large number of classes and a small number of examples in each class, then the task becomes non-trivial (the best example in business is training a model on the classification of product directories).
    The package facilitates the solution of such specific tasks that are not so rare in business.
